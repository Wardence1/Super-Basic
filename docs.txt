Super Basic is based around super basic commands and stacks.
There are no variables here.
For each "data type" there's as stack.

Data Types: Numbers, Strings

COMMANDS:
print <any> : prints out the first arg
prints <string> : prints out the string at the top of the stack, arg1 is optional and will be printed after
printn <string> : prints out the number at the top of the stack, arg1 is optional and will be printed after

push <any> : pushes the first arg onto the stack based on its data type

pops : pops the string on top of the string stack
popn : pops the number on top of the number stack

add <number> : adds arg1 to the number at the top of the number stack
sub <number> : subtracts arg1 from the number at the top of the number stack

inputs : gets a string of input from the user and pushes it onto the string stack
inputn : gets a number of input from the user and pushes it onto the number stack
