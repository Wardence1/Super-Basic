Super Basic is based around super basic commands and stacks.
There are no variables here.
For each "data type" there's as stack.
Programs will start at the "start" label.
A command will at most have two arguments.

Data Types:Strings
<string> a string of text beginning and ending with quotes
<number> All integers
<symbol> Could be "=", ">", or "<". The symbol does not have to be in quotes.
<label> Defined as "name" then ":", labels are not type sensitive.

COMMANDS:
print <any> : Prints out arg1
prints <string> : Prints out the string at the top of the stack, arg1 is optional and will be printed after
printn <string> : Prints out the number at the top of the stack, arg1 is optional and will be printed after

push <any> : Pushes the first arg onto the stack based on its data type

pops : Pops the string on top of the string stack
popn : Pops the number on top of the number stack

add <number> : Adds arg1 to the number at the top of the number stack
sub <number> : Subtracts arg1 from the number at the top of the number stack

inputs : Gets a string of input from the user and pushes it onto the string stack
inputn : Gets a number of input from the user and pushes it onto the number stack

cmp <symbol> <number> : Sets the carry flag based on the top number in the number stack and the symbol

jmp <label> : Jumps to the specified label
jmpt <label> <number> : Jumps if the carry flag is set to true
jmpf <label> <number> : Jumps if the carry flag is set to false

exit : Ends the program

; : Comments out the line
